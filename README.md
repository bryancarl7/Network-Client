# Network-Client
Very basic server/client 

Client:
It will send lists of Primes to the server and will wait for the server to bounce them back. There are a lot of try blocks and will be stopped before anything detrimental.

Server:
The Server will determine which numbers are prime and add them to array. The Server will then bounce those values back to the Client.
